# [OFFICIAL] AARCOMM Virtualized RCU CAN Interface

This Flutter application provides a virtual interface for simulating digital remote control systems using CAN-based communication over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Designed for embedded testing and hardware simulation, it emulates real-time CAN frame generation based on digital control states. It interfaces with devices such as the **Puisi MCBox** via BLE and provides full logging and filtering of CAN messages.

## Features

- Digital button groups for **Engine, Boom, Vacuum, Water Pump, Door, Wand, and more**
- Live CAN frame generation and transmission using structured 8-byte payloads
- BLE scanning, filtering, and connection via **flutter_blue_plus**
- Transmits CAN messages using the **Axiomatic CAN-to-Bluetooth Converter**
- Displays both **live and deduplicated (fixed)** CAN frame logs
- Multi-column filtering (Channel, ID, DLC, Data, Time, Direction, Contents)
- Live status indicator, stopwatch timer, and frame replay options
- Support for real CAN monitoring using **Kvaser CANking** or **PCAN-View**

## CAN Byte Mapping

The app encodes digital button states into specific byte/bit positions of an 8-byte CAN payload:

| Control Name                      | Byte | Bit | Description                       |

## Getting Started
> [!IMPORTANT]
>1. Connect the **Axiomatic Converter** to the **Puisi MCBox** and ensure the CAN network is powered and ensure to connect the Kvaser Hybrid CAN/LIN to the Windows device for mionitoring. Ensure to launch the application Kvaser CAN-king.

> - **Axiomatic Converter**

2. Launch the Flutter app on your device. *cross-platform support pending*

 _Flutter Application is launched via macOS "flutter run" then select '1' - This will soon be changed for cross platform usage_

4. Open Kvaser Can King (ensuring all the requiremnts above are met in terms of connection with the MCBOX and Axiomatic BT device as well as connecting the Kvaser Leaf lite to "Windows Device") then select _go on bus_.

5.Use the virtual buttons to simulate control states from "AARCOM RCU Digital Control Buttons" and then select "Send to CanKing"

6. Open the Kvaser CAN Log output window and try generating frames to send to the AARCOM Virtualized RCU:

7. Observe the behaviour of the Data in the "CAN Frame logs" in terms of data that was "Transmitted and Received" the logs are in _Fixed Format_ for readability:

8. Observe the Kvaser Can King Output window where you can see the most recent data sent populating to corresponding CAN ID and the information that was sent via the Universal Generator:
